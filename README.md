Research-grade code for the thesis "Global Inference and Local Syntax Representations for Event Extraction"

This repository contains code for Chapter 5, where I built syntax-based event extractors, i.e., extractors which operate on the entire dependency graph of a sentence. The system first identifies triggers based on this information, and then predicts which of the (given) entity mentions play which roles in the respective event.

Please not that this code is (a) very old, (b) not maintained in any form. However, it specifies how the experiments were carried out. Please also note that I cannot add the training, development or test data used because it is directly derived from ACE 2005.
